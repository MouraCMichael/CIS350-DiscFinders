# Meeting Minutes 9/18/2020

Team name: Disc Finders

Members present: Timothy Beler, Corey Moura

Date: 9/18/2020

Time: 2 - 3pm

First meeting as a team regarding project goals, timelines, and workload. Plan on discussing the technological capabilities of the RFID chips. 

## Discussion points 

#### Group Work

1. Elevator Pitch
<br>
    Have you ever been disc golfing and lost your disc in the bushes?  We’ve got an app for that.

2. Plans for the project and why is it useful/important/cool
<br>
    We would like to build an app that implements RFID technology in a smart phone in order to locate a disc golfers lost disc.  This app will theoretically eliminate the possibility of losing a disc and significantly reduce time spent on the course searching.  This app will leave the player feeling worry free when trying new shots, or throwing on “blind” holes.

3. Two features we plan on implementing
    Log multiple RFID tags
    - The ability for the user to pair the passive RFID tag to their smart phone through the app.  
    - The player should have a list of their discs in the app which the app can identify on the course.

    User feedback while searching
    - The app should provide feedback for the user to determine if the user is getting closer or further from their lost disc.

##### Process for the project:
- Iterative 
- Throwaway Prototyping

##### Proposed Semester Long Assignments - 
- Design App GUI
- Manage RFID Technology
- Implement RFID communications

##### Where do we start on this project:
- Research the technology required
- Become familiar with Android Studio and uploading the code onto Github

##### Anticipated Technologies:
- Corey is using homebrew; Tim is using Github Desktop/Git Bash
- Java
- Android Studio

##### Methods/Approach
- Research Phase

##### Estimated Timeline
- Week 1 research available technologies

Embedded Raspberry Pi vs Phone App
Embedded active RFID chip vs having a sticker



##### Goals for next week (include responsibilities)
