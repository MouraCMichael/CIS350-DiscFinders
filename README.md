# Disc Finders

All disc golfers will eventually throw a bad shot on the course.  Sometimes they are so bad, it can be difficult to find where the disc landed.  This project is dedicated to helping speed up the search process, and prevent players from losing discs.  Our goal is to write an android based app which impliments RFID technology to accomplish this task.
