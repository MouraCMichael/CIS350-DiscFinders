# Introduction
*(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)*

The sport of disc golfing is played similarly to that of traditional golf.  Like golf, there are tee pads, fairways, roughs, boundaries, penalty strokes, and score is kept using the par, birdie, boggy method.  There are 18 holes in each course like traditional golf, and there is a “front 9” and a “back 9”.  But instead of a club and ball, the player throws a roughly 9” wide disc that has similar flight characteristics of a beach frisby except fly much further.  The discs are designed with physical differences that affect the flight characteristics.  These differences create 4 main subcategories: drivers, fairway drivers, midranges, and putters.  The goal of the sport is to throw the disc into a chain-link-type basket or also known as a target.

Generally, if the disc is thrown well, it will land in the fairway. A well thrown disc is easy to track in the sky and will land in the fairway where the player can easily find it.  If a player has a bad throw, the disc will go into the “rough” where, many times, it can no longer be seen.  It is not uncommon for a disc’s flight path to be altered by a tree and there is always the possibility of  landing on the ground in a way which causes the disc to “roll away”.  For scenarios like this, players can only guess an approximate location of where the disc has landed. 
 
Discs are made in an assortment of colors.  Colors vary, but usually lean toward the fluorescent “unnatural” colors, which can make it easy for the player to find the disc in the woods, thick grass or brush on the course.  These vibrant colors help to find most lost discs, but often, the player will not find their disc if the brush is too thick or the disc has been redirected to a completely different location.  

This proposal aims to develop an app which will help players find these otherwise lost discs.  The aim is to use light-weight, long range passive RFID stickers placed under the flight plate of the disc and a mobile device transmitter to produce a location tracking system.  The apps functionality aims to display location information to the player when the player is within range. 


# Anticipated Technologies
*(What technologies are needed to build this project)*

The exact method to achieve the end product is pending and will be based on available technology, compatibility, and cost.  Some of the currently discussed technologies include: Android Studio (app creation), Raspberry Pi (Link RFID to App), RFID Tags, Raspberry Pi, and  RFID Piggybacks.


# Method/Approach
*(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)*

The foremost goal is researching available technology.  RFID is a growing technology and therefore may not be widely available for this application.  Next would be project planning, in which the specifications and requirements will be defined.  Once this is complete, the team can begin on writing the mobile application and hardware implementation.  Once implementation begins, and as soon as possible, testing will begin.  

# Estimated Timeline
*(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it may take to reach that point)*

Hardware selection will be one of the biggest milestones.  It may take a couple weeks to research applicable, and available technologies for this project.  Additional checkpoints include: successfully interfacing the raspberry pie to the android app, and also passing RFID data to the app.  This will require approximately two months to complete with the teams current understanding.


# Anticipated Problems
*(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)*

Long range RFID is a developing technology and there may not be a lot of piggybacks available for us to use in order to implement.  Additionally, there may be a lack of documentation for interfacing RFID with a raspberry pie, or to an android application.  The team's hope is to find hardware that comes with an SDK to make implementation smooth.
